# Bayesian-Causal-Network-modeling
Looking for causal relationships in your data? Use Bayesian causal networks to understand the connections between your variables. A Bayesian causal network model is a causal graph where nodes represent random variables and edges represent the relationships between them. Each random variable is associated with a conditional probability distribution (CPDs).
In this repository, I've used Bayesian Networks (BN) on my dataset to understand the relationships between several behavioral parameters and questionnaire indices.
